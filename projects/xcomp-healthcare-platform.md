# XComP Healthcare Education Platform

Built a clinical competency assessment platform for dental students at East Carolina University Dental School. The platform enables real-time clinical grading and comprehensive competency tracking throughout students' educational journey.

## Role

Senior Developer / Technical Lead (2018 - 2022)

## The Challenge

Dental schools needed a way to assess student competency in real-time clinical settings. Traditional paper-based grading was inefficient and made it difficult to track student progress across multiple competency areas. The platform needed to work reliably in live clinical environments where faculty grade students during actual patient procedures.

## Key Achievements

- **Successful launch** in June 2022 after 4-year development cycle
- **Real-time grading interface** built for live clinical settings
- **Complex competency grid** reporting system developed
- **Delivered under tight budget** constraints
- **System stability** maintained through production launch

## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Grading Interface

Architected a complex grading interface optimized for live clinical settings. Faculty can quickly assess student performance during procedures, with the interface designed for speed and accuracy in high-pressure environments.

### Competency Tracking System

Built a comprehensive competency grid that tracks student progress across multiple assessment areas. The system provides detailed visualizations and reports to help faculty and students understand areas of strength and needed improvement.

### State Management

Implemented complex state management with Redux to handle the intricate data relationships between students, procedures, competencies, and assessments. Ensured data integrity across real-time updates from multiple concurrent users.

## Technologies Used

- React with JavaScript
- Redux for state management
- Node.js microservices
- PostgreSQL database
- Data visualization libraries

## Challenges Overcome

- Managing complexity over a 4-year development timeline
- Balancing ongoing maintenance with new feature development
- Handling tight budget constraints
- Ensuring reliability for critical clinical grading scenarios
- Supporting diverse user needs (faculty, students, administrators)

## Impact

The platform now supports dental education at East Carolina University, providing faculty with efficient tools for clinical assessment and students with clear visibility into their competency development. The successful launch after 4 years of development demonstrated the ability to deliver complex healthcare education systems.
