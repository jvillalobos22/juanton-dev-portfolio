# Medi-Cal Provider Portal

Led frontend architecture and design systems for California's modernized Medi-Cal provider portal, a multi-tenant healthcare platform serving 50,000+ healthcare providers managing $120M+ in annual claims and reimbursements.

## Role

Software Engineering Lead / Frontend Technical Lead (October 2022 - Present)

## The Challenge

California's Department of Health Care Services needed to modernize their legacy provider portal system. The platform required enterprise-grade security for HIPAA compliance, accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1), and the ability to scale across multiple squads while maintaining consistent quality and development velocity.

## Key Achievements

- **312% velocity increase** — Grew sprint capacity from 25 to 103 story points
- **40% faster development** — Through design system and component reuse
- **Team scaling** — Successfully grew team from 2 to 7 developers
- **Organization-wide impact** — Standards adopted across all squads (40+ engineers)
- **Performance optimization** — 40% reduction in initial load time
- **Testing coverage** — Improved from 40% to 85%

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

Established comprehensive frontend architecture patterns including folder structure, state management strategies, data fetching patterns, and error boundaries. Created canonical patterns for component architecture using TypeScript with strict mode enforcement.

### Design System Leadership

Built an atomic design system from scratch using Storybook for comprehensive component documentation with live demos. Created a design-development workflow integrating Adobe XD and Figma, and established weekly design system meetings across squads.

### Quality & Standards

- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- Automated accessibility audits
- PR review checklists and templates
- Performance budgets and bundle size limits

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Next.js
- GraphQL
- Tailwind CSS
- Storybook
- Jest and Cypress
- OpenShift / Kubernetes
- Jenkins CI/CD

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations

- HIPAA-compliant systems with strict security requirements
- Interfaces for complex healthcare workflows (claims, billing, reimbursement)
- 99.9% uptime for clinical users
- Secure handling of sensitive patient data

## Impact

The platform now serves 50,000+ healthcare providers across California, streamlining claims processing and payment cycles. The design system and architecture patterns I established reduced development time by 40% and enabled faster feature delivery across all squads.
