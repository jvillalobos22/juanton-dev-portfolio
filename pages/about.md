## The Journey

I started my career in 2014 building responsive websites for small businesses. What began as simple client work evolved into a passion for understanding how great interfaces come together—not just the code, but the design thinking, user research, and systematic approaches that make software truly work for people.

At IBM Consulting, I've had the privilege of working on systems that genuinely matter. The California Medi-Cal Provider Portal serves 50,000+ healthcare providers managing benefits for some of the state's most vulnerable populations. Building for healthcare taught me that good enough isn't good enough—when your users are managing patient care, every detail matters.

## What Sets Me Apart

I'm not your typical frontend engineer. While many developers specialize in either technical implementation or design collaboration, I've deliberately built expertise in both. I can facilitate a design thinking workshop in the morning, architect a component library in the afternoon, and mentor junior developers through complex TypeScript patterns before the day ends.

This combination is rare, and it's valuable. Companies don't just need people who can write code—they need people who can bridge the gap between what designers envision and what's technically possible, while advocating for the user every step of the way.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking a mission-driven role at a smaller company where I can have direct product impact. I want to work closely with design and product teams, not just receive requirements from them. Staff-level or senior IC roles with architectural influence are ideal—I want to shape how things are built, not just build them.

Healthcare technology and mission-driven sectors particularly interest me. After spending years building systems for vulnerable populations, I've found that work matters more when it genuinely helps people.
